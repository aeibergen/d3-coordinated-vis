		<p>Perhaps the most popular stereotype one will hear from other countries concerning the US is that its citizens are unhealthy and overweight, and it seems to be true. According to The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, more than two-thirds (68.8 percent) of adults are considered to be overweight or obese, and over one-third (35.7 percent) of US adults are considered to be obese. The above map and graph are an attempt to visualize the geography of obesity (as well as its contributing factors).
